Andrew Zelano and Isaac Pontarelli
CSC 411 assignment 3 (Locality)

We implemented code in ppmtrans, uarray2 (from the previous iii assignment), and uarray2b.
All other files are part of the assignment starter code that was given.

We have correctly implemented the rotate 90, 180, and 270 as well as the row, column and block major.

Architecture documentation:

For the underlying 2d array datastructure we used our implementation from the last assignment (iii).
This is a row major 2d array with a spine and arrays for the rows. Hanson Arrays are used for both
the spine and the rows. This with the addition of a column major mapping function this made up the 
majority of a2plain.

A2blocked also used our uarray2 code, however 1d Hanson arrays were stored in each cell to represent
the blocks. This is technically now a 3d array and could definitly be expressed in a simpler fashion.



Measured speeds:
Our speeds where measured using the winter.jpg scaled 2.5 times. These times are the
average of 3 trials using the time command in linux and reporting the user cpu time.
Units are seconds.

rotation	row major	col major	block major
90		11.83		12.44		15.50
180		9.19		17.25		18.89

Predicted speeds:
these are the levels we assigned to the different operations in our design phase.

rotation 	row major	col major	block major
90		4		4		2
180		1		5		3


We estimate that we have spent approximately 16 hours including the first submission (documentation).
